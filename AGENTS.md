# Project continuation rules

These rules apply to every Codex session and delegated task in this repository.

## Required reading before work

1. Read `SPEC.md`, `SCORING_ALGORITHM.md`, and the relevant PRD section.
2. Read `tasks/parallel-work.md` before assigning, resuming, or implementing work.
3. Read the relevant `tasks/**/plan.md`, `tasks/**/todo.md`, latest ADRs, and latest integration report.
4. Recalculate progress from acceptance checklists; do not reuse an old percentage from chat history.

## Parallel-work authority

- `tasks/parallel-work.md` is the canonical ownership, dependency, and resume protocol for phases F1-F9.
- Use at most five worker tasks at once while the current task remains coordinator/integrator.
- A worker may modify only its assigned directories and files. Shared contracts, routes, migrations, lockfiles, ADR numbering, and canonical checklists belong to the coordinator unless explicitly assigned.
- One task owns database migrations at a time. Freeze shared DTO/API contracts before backend, frontend, or psychometric work proceeds in parallel.
- Do not dispatch a duplicate continuation to a task that is still running. Review its commit and verification evidence before giving it another increment.
- Do not count a task as complete merely because a worker reports completion; acceptance criteria and relevant tests must pass.

## Safety and continuity

- Preserve existing uncommitted and untracked files unless their ownership is explicitly assigned.
- Never use production secrets, real participant data, live payment/notification actions, active database migrations, deployment, or feature activation as synthetic verification.
- At every handoff, record task ID, branch/worktree, owned files, baseline commit, result commit, tests, blockers, and next dependency in `tasks/parallel-work.md` or a linked integration report.
- After an interrupted or closed session, follow the resume checklist in `tasks/parallel-work.md`; do not restart planning from chat memory.

## Coordination role

- A separate Claude Code session acts as coordinator/gatekeeper across every
  tool used on this project (Codex, GLM, others). It does not receive live
  messages from other tools — a human relays prompts and results manually
  between sessions.
- No branch is promoted to canonical/`main`, committed as a merge, pushed, or
  force-pushed until the coordinator has independently re-verified the
  evidence (re-running or re-inspecting tests/diffs directly in the
  repository), not merely accepted a worker's self-report.
- Any tool finishing an increment must push its branch to `origin` so the
  coordinator can audit it directly via `git`, even without direct access to
  that tool's own session or chat history.
- If a tool's chat history disagrees with the coordinator's git-based audit,
  the audit wins, per the existing "recalculate progress" rule above.
- A worker (any tool) that finds ambiguity between two already-merged
  branches' contracts (schema, DTO, fixture expectations) must report the
  ambiguity for a joint decision rather than silently resolving it by
  loosening a constraint, deleting a check, or picking one side without
  recording why.
