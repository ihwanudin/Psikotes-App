# Project continuation rules

These rules apply to every Codex session and delegated task in this repository.

## Required reading before work

1. Read `SPEC.md`, `SCORING_ALGORITHM.md`, and the relevant PRD section.
2. Read `tasks/parallel-work.md` before assigning, resuming, or implementing work.
3. Read the relevant `tasks/**/plan.md`, `tasks/**/todo.md`, latest ADRs, and latest integration report.
4. Recalculate progress from acceptance checklists; do not reuse an old percentage from chat history.

## Parallel-work authority

- `tasks/parallel-work.md` is the canonical ownership, dependency, and resume protocol for phases F1-F9.
- Use at most five worker tasks at once while the current task remains coordinator/integrator.
- A worker may modify only its assigned directories and files. Shared contracts, routes, migrations, lockfiles, ADR numbering, and canonical checklists belong to the coordinator unless explicitly assigned.
- One task owns database migrations at a time. Freeze shared DTO/API contracts before backend, frontend, or psychometric work proceeds in parallel.
- Do not dispatch a duplicate continuation to a task that is still running. Review its commit and verification evidence before giving it another increment.
- Do not count a task as complete merely because a worker reports completion; acceptance criteria and relevant tests must pass.

## Safety and continuity

- Preserve existing uncommitted and untracked files unless their ownership is explicitly assigned.
- Never use production secrets, real participant data, live payment/notification actions, active database migrations, deployment, or feature activation as synthetic verification.
- At every handoff, record task ID, branch/worktree, owned files, baseline commit, result commit, tests, blockers, and next dependency in `tasks/parallel-work.md` or a linked integration report.
- After an interrupted or closed session, follow the resume checklist in `tasks/parallel-work.md`; do not restart planning from chat memory.
